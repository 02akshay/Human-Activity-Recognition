# Human-Activity-Recognition
<br />
This is a sequential classification problem which I am trying to solve by predicting human activity, given their accelerometer  and gyroscope readings.<br />
Human activity recognotion is a vintage concept which has gained importance over the years. Border security, athletes and general surveillance being some of its applications, I decided to implement this project to get a deeper understanding of deep neural networks. My goals from this project was to prove that standard neural networks fail to accurately predict data when its previous state or history of the object is taken into consideration and also to prove that deep neural networks works best in this scenario.<br />
<br />
Having completed the first goal, I am currently in the process of improving the accuracy of Recurrent Neural Network. I have also finalized an Android simulator which can give me accelorometer and gyroscope readings which will act as live imputs to my algorithm. Having obtained satisfactory results from this, I plan to develope an Android app and integrate my model into it.<br />

Stay tuned for more updates :)
